<p>It is important not to spend all your money on current consumption and not to postpone the start of saving for later, saying, "When I have more money, I will save." </p>

<p>Saving does not mean misleading, but on the contrary - it reflects the rational planning of your finances. And the ability to systematically lay down even a small amount of money is a very valuable habit that affects the whole of your life. Persons in action easily achieve their goals.</p>

<p>In the life of a student who learns to stay away from his family home, who is just shaping his personality and developing interests and often not thinking about the future, there are many situations in which one must confront his or her image with reality. One such moment is the time when you have to spend financially. How to deal with it?</p>
                    </section>
                    
     <li><h5>1. Plan your shopping</h5><p>Buying a product by a strictly defined list will sort out your purchases. Chaos associated with unplanned purchases of food often ends with money spent on unnecessary sweets or other tempting-looking sweets.</p>
</li>

                

<li><h5>2. Do big shopping once a week</h5><p>Find out how many products you eat during the week and do, for example, on a weekend, large shopping bags. This will allow you to better manage your food, and additionally this will allow you to take advantage of the exciting promotions offered by the supermarkets.</p></li>



<li><h5>3. Check out market promotions</h5>

<p>Large supermarkets can afford better offers than local stores. When doing bulk shopping, you may find that you have saved a significant amount of money.</p></li>
