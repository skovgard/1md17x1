            <p> First there is findtheinvisiblecow.com - name says it all!</p>

  <div class="quote" >        
<p>"It’s like Cinderella’s slipper. She can give her name and confirm where she was before midnight, but it’s only when the slipper fits that Prince Charming knows she’s for real. The Prince was an early adopter of 2FA."</p>
