            <p>Who doesn't like eating out? For young people living away from home and on a budget this is a serious temptation. However, eating out is costly and not always the best case nutrition wise. </p>
<p>An app called "Eat This Much" is a great solution to this issue. It's a "personal diet assistant" . The app comes with many great features. You can track your diet goals, budget and schedule your meals. And yes - it comes with recipees! The app will generate you a personal complete meal plan.</p>
            
<p>You can also just use their website - it is not necessary to download the app. </p>

<p>Another great app, especially for those who like take away food and are on budget is Too Good To Go. </p>
            
<p>Founded in 2015 in Copenhagen, Too Good To Go has grown rapidly, now existing in six countries (Denmark, Norway, the UK, France, Germany and Switzerland).</p>
<p>It is a win win for both consumers and food business. Cafes, restaurants and bakeries get to sell their leftowers, making a small profit. The consumers get to pick up some cheap food. Cool, eh?</p>
            
<p>You simply download the app and see where you can get a bargain meal locally. </p>

<p>And of course the whole idea is to fight against food waste! According to their UK website, 4500 stores have saved 1.6m meals. Impressive!</p>
