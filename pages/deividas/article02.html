            <p> Color is vital for visual design. However, there are so many of them that it is hard to keep track. Not anymore though!</p>
            
<p>ColorHexa is presented as the encyclopedia of color. It provides much needed information and conversion</p>
            
<p>The website covers many things regarding each color. For instance - hex codes, RGB values CMYK and more. Moreover, you are provided with color schemes with your colors for complementary, analogous any other color.</p>

<p>ColorHexa also shows how your color of your choice is perceived by people affected by color deficiency </p>
            
<p>Don't miss out!</p>
            
<p>Moving on to labs.500px.com - online photography community's marketplace.</p>
            
<p>What is interesting about this website is that instead of using keywords to search one has to use color! </p>

<p>It is simple and fun to use. First you pick color and size of brush. Then Splash paint on the canvas and see matching images appear. Simply amazing!</p>

       
<p>You get access to search and find high quality photos according to your needs. Then you can buy and download the photos you like.
